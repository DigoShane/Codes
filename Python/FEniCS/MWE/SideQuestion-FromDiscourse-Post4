My original post under "DiscoursePost4.py" had a vauge answer form Dokken. So i decided to ask a followup question asking for clarification.
At this time, I was having some issue reading the documentation for ufl. So i decided to post some questions there. I ended up removing it.
I think its better to ask in a separate thread.

The following is what i removed from the original post.

==============================================================================
This is a side note/ side doubt, but something that is very helpful cause I think it would help me find answers myself; so less stupid questions for you guys to deal with. It is with regards to reading the documentation for ufl. I'll number the questions, but they are consecutive.

1. The command "derivative" doesn't show up in the documentation for commands. 

     I printed the version of ufl I'm using (I think the following is correct)
     ```
     Import ufl 
     print(f" UFL version: {ufl.__version__}")
     ```
     and it returned
     ```UFL version: 2019.1.0```

     So I googled the documentation for [UFL 2019.1.0](https://fenics.readthedocs.io/projects/ufl/en/2019.1.0/index.html) and searched "derivative" and got [this](https://fenics.readthedocs.io/projects/ufl/en/2019.1.0/api-doc/ufl.algorithms.html?highlight=derivative#module-ufl.algorithms.apply_derivatives). It mentions different types of derivatives, but I can't find 'derivative' as in the command 'derivative' in the first example in [this page of the ufl manual](https://fenics.readthedocs.io/projects/ufl/en/2019.1.0/manual/form_language.html#automatic-functional-differentiation). I'm not sure if I misunderstand the documentation under [API reference](https://fenics.readthedocs.io/projects/ufl/en/2019.1.0/api-doc/ufl.html).

2. Not clear what the commands described in the ufl documentation mean.

     I would also like to ask what the documentation for ufl actually means. For example consider the command " [`ufl.algorithms.apply_derivatives.` `CoordinateDerivativeRuleset`](https://fenics.readthedocs.io/projects/ufl/en/2019.1.0/api-doc/ufl.algorithms.html#ufl.algorithms.apply_derivatives.CoordinateDerivativeRuleset)". It says it needs " *coefficients* , *arguments* , *coefficient_derivatives*". While i understand the first two, the last one is not clear. What is "coefficient_derivavative", i couldn't find it anywhere in the manual. Below the definition are some "keywords",

     `argument` (*o* )

     `coefficient` (*o* )

     `geometric_quantity` (*o* )

     `grad` (*o* )

     `jacobian` (*o* )

     `reference_grad` (*g* )

     `reference_value` (*o* )

     `spatial_coordinate` (*o* )

     what are these? What is the 'o' in the argument of these keywords? How are they related to the `ufl.algorithms.apply_derivatives.CoordinateDerivativeRuleset`?
